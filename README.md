# Hanami Ruby 3.0

Monkey patches Hanami components to support Ruby 3.0

## Overview

To use this gem, make sure your app works with Ruby 2.7.6.

This should only be installed for a short time, during the Hanami Upgrade process.
It just overrides a few of the Hanami classes, replacing code raising deprecation
warnings with updated code supported Ruby 3.0 syntax.
